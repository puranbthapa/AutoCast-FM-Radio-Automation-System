Each line follows this format:
```
HH:MM=ACTION=PATH=ACTION=PATH...
```

Example:
```
06:00=TIME_CHECK=time_checks=JINGLE=jingles=ADS=ads=MUSIC=music
17:30=JINGLE=jingles=ADS=ads=JINGLE_2=jingles=MUSIC=music
```

### Content Types (Actions)

1. **TIME_CHECK**: Time announcements
2. **JINGLE**: Station jingles
3. **ADS**: Advertisements
4. **JINGLE_2**: Secondary jingles
5. **MUSIC**: Music tracks
6. **BHAJANS**: Religious content
7. **OLD LOK GEET**: Traditional songs
8. **OLD SAD NEPALI SONGS**: Evening content

### Using the Schedule Editor

For detailed instructions on using the Schedule Editor, see [SCHEDULE_EDITOR_MANUAL.md](SCHEDULE_EDITOR_MANUAL.md).

## Logging System

The system maintains comprehensive logs to help monitor operation and troubleshoot issues:

- **Action Log**: Records all system actions with timestamps
  - Location: `logs/action_log.txt`
  - Contents: Program starts, schedule parsing, file playback, etc.

- **Error Log**: Records errors and exceptions
  - Location: `logs/error_log.txt`
  - Contents: File access issues, playback problems, etc.

Logs use automatic rotation to prevent excessive file sizes (5MB limit with 5 backup files).

## Advanced Configuration

### Schedule Templates

The system supports schedule templates for easier management. Templates are defined in:
```
templates/schedule_templates.json
```

Schedule patterns (repeated hourly formats) are defined in:
```
templates/schedule_patterns.json
```

### Content Selection Rules

- **Random Selection**: Jingles and similar content are selected randomly
- **Shuffle Play**: Music files are shuffled before playback
- **Duplication Avoidance**: The system tries to avoid recently played tracks
- **File Limits**: Maximum of 30 music files per slot to prevent overruns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Sound**:
   - Check Winamp is installed correctly
   - Verify audio device settings
   - Check if files exist in the specified paths

2. **Missed Schedules**:
   - Check schedule file format
   - Verify system time is correct
   - Look for errors in the error log

3. **Playback Problems**:
   - Check file formats are supported
   - Verify file paths are correct
   - Look for specific errors in logs/error_log.txt

### Log Analysis

When troubleshooting:
1. Check `logs/action_log.txt` for system actions
